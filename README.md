Gpseq is a GObject utility library providing parallel data processing.

```vala
using Gpseq;

string[] array = {"dog", "cat", "pig", "boar", "bear"};
Seq.of_array<string>((owned) array)
	.parallel()
	.filter((g) => g.length == 3)
	.map<string>((g) => g.up())
	.foreach((g) => print("%s\n", g));

// (unordered) output:
// DOG
// CAT
// PIG
```
